## Tone of Voice

Tone of voice is less about what you say, and more about how you say it. Content written for our user groups should be inspirational and instill a sense of hope or curiosity. Content will be written as if patient is in consultation with an experienced, caring provider, who is there to answer questions in a frank, but compassionate manner.

Although the primary goal is to drive users to inquire about treatment at Roswell Park, tone should avoid being salesy or pushy. Give the user all the information and space s/he needs to come to their own conclusions

### Tone

The tone of voice in our copy may change slightly based on the target audience.
- Educational
- Friendly
- Informative
- Helpful
- Warm &amp; Inviting
- Hopeful

### Content Considerations

Content will convey the following aspects:
- Informed
- Credible
- Reassuring
- Enduring
- Encouraging
- Truthful
- On Their Level

_Should we add "compassionate" in here somewhere? Also, we've noticed a trend in a lot of highly ranked cancer sites where they focus on the helpful, reassuring, and encouraging tones before going in for the informed, credible, and education tones._

## Reading Level
While cancer patients may be educated and seek information, most adults read at the 8th or 9th grade level. Users must be able to both understand the information provided to them, and also understand what options are available to them. It’s difficult to use plain language in place of terminology, but when possible, choose user-friendly terms in place of medical jargon. You may also use jargon, but define terms in plain language. When in doubt, run your content through a readability test (MS Word is the most accessible, with Flesch-Kincaid built into the Spelling and Grammar tool.)
