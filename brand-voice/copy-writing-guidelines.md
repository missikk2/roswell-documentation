## Project Considerations

Before beginning a project, these questions should be answered. They can inform a good direction to take the copy and content.

### Questions to Ask Before Every Project

- What is the desired action, key message or result from this project?
- Who is the primary target audience? Secondary?
- What would happen if we didn't do this communication?
- How does this fit into our mission?

## Point of View

Write content from first and second point of view (POV), using “We” and “Our” to represent the Center, and “you” and “your” for your target audiences. Using first and second POV establishes a personal, human relationship with our audiences and immediately cultivates brand trust. Users care about themselves and what they get out of it, so make the content about them (the patient).

### Tips For Stronger Writing

**Avoid beginning a sentence with "There is" or "There are".**
_Instead of:_ "There are studies that show..."
_Use:_ "Studies show that..."

**Use active rather than passive voice.**
_Passive:_ "In the last two years, 348 transplants were performed."
_Active:_ "In the last two years, Roswell Park performed 348 transplants."
When in doubt: Subject/Verb/Object

**Focus on the team &amp; human element rather than the study.**

## Web Best Practices

**Headings:**
Always use the H1, H2, H3 heading hierarchy. Make sure there is only one of each.

_After you have 3 headings, you can jump to H6 for all the rest?_

**Fonts/Typefaces:**
NEVER change font styles or colors, unless approved by a designer.

**Files:**
