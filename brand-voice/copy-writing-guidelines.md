# Copy Writing Guidelines

## Project Considerations

Before beginning a project, these questions should be answered. They can inform a good direction to take the copy and content.

#### Questions to Ask Before Every Project

* What is the desired action, key message or result from this project?
* Who is the primary target audience? Secondary?
* What would happen if we didn't do this communication?
* How does this fit into our communication?

## Point of View

Write content from first and second point of view \(POV\), using "We" and "Our" to represent the Center, and "you" and "your" for your target audiences. Using first and second POV establishes a personal, human relationship with our audiences and immediately cultivates brand trust. Users care about themselves and what they get out of it, so make the content about them \(the patient\).

## Writing Tips

The style of our copy is very important to maintaining a consistent voice throughout out website.

### Tips for Stronger Writing

#### Avoid beginning a sentence with "There is" or "There are".

Instead of: "There are studies that show..."

Use: "Studies show that..."
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
### Tips for Stronger Writing

#### Use active rather than passive voice.

Passive: "In the last two years, 348 transplants were performed."

Active: "In the last two years, Roswell Park performed 348 transplants." When in doubt: Subject/Verb/Object

### Tips for Stronger Writing

#### Focus on the team & human elements rather than the study.

## Web Best Practices

#### Headings

Always use the H1, H2, H3 heading hierarchy. Make sure there is only one of each.

_After you have 3 headings, you can jump to H6 for all the rest?_

#### Typefaces

NEVER change font styles or colors, unless approved by a designer.

#### Files

?

_Perhaps an example of a properly formatted blog post?_
