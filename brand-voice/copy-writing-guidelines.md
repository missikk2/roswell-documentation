## Project Considerations

Before beginning a project, these questions should be answered. They can inform a good direction to take the copy and content.

### Questions to Ask Before Every Project

- What is the desired action, key message or result from this project?
- Who is the primary target audience? Secondary?
- What would happen if we didn't do this communication?
- How does this fit into our mission?

### Tips For Stronger Writing

Avoid beginning a sentence with "There is" or "There are".
_Instead of:_ "There are studies that show..."
_Use:_ "Studies show that..."

Use active rather than passive voice.
_Passive:_ "In the last two years, 348 transplants were performed."
_Active:_ "In the last two years, Roswell Park performed 348 transplants."
When in doubt: Subject/Verb/Object

Focus on the team &amp; human element rather than the study.
