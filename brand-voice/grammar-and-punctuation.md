# Grammar & Punctuation

## Trusted Industry Resources

* NCI
* ACS
* CDC
* ACOG
* NCCN Guidelines

_It would be nice to have links for these._

## Credentials

* Use formal names with credentials.
* Use formal title if available.
* Do not use periods in MC or PhD.
* On first reference, use all credentials following the doctor's name, set off by commas. Use "Dr." on second reference only. This is important to keep consistent at an institution that employs many MDs and PhDs.
* For nursing credentials, follow ANA guidelines.

_The best I can find is _[_this_](http://www.nursecredentialing.org/DisplayCredentials-Brochure.pdf)_ for nursing guidelines. I'll need a link to the actual guidelines._

#### Examples

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="General Credentials" %}
"Candace S. Johnson, PhD" "David Scott, Director of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion" "Norbert Fleemer, MD, gave the keynote address. Dr. Fleemer is a world-renowned hematologic oncologist."
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Nursing Credentials" %}
"An example of how to list a nurse's titles goes here"
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Titles \(Need clarification on what kind\)

Use all titles when possible or the most appropriate to the context of the story. Default to highest title.

_That doesn't make a lot of sense._

* If too many characters to add all titles, try to work in other titles throughout article, or use department.
* Prefer the clinical title over the academic title in consumer copy. Academic titles should be used in press releases.

## Names & Designations

Something here about the usage of names and designations

#### Examples

Use "&" rather than "and" for titles of programs.

## Use of Italics

Use italics to add emphasis within a sentence. Do not use italics to coin a new term \(See quotation marks\).

#### Examples

## Use of Quotation Marks

* Only use for direct quotes or introducing a new term or new use of a term. Do not use to emphasize content.
* In headlines, use single quotation marks in lieu of double quotation marks.
* Within direct quotes by the same person that continues with several paragraphs, do not close the quote until they are done speaking. Start each paragraph with new quotation.
* Generally use _says_ rather than _said_ unless it needs to be clear that the statement was made in the past.

## Numbers & Phone Numbers

#### Phone Numbers

Do not use parentheses around 716. Use hyphens only.

#### General Numbers

Spell out zero to ten; 11 and up use numerals, unless the number is referring to a measurement \(age, percentages, etc.\).

#### Examples

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Phone Numbers" %}
716-845-2908
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Numbers" %}
PSA &lt; 1
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Lists

* Use periods for complete sentences.
* Be consistent with punctuation. If using a period, use it for every list item.
* For Web: If there are multiple sentences within each bullet, consider using headlines.
* If using a colon in the intro of a bulleted list, use a period \(for full sentences\) or a dash after the key word\(s\).
* Bold key words.

#### Examples

Find some examples. Add web example of headlines on a list.

## Em Dashes vs Hyphens

Do not use a hyphen \( - \) in place of an em dash \( — \). Spaces go on each side of dashes. Use an em dash when you want to shout something; parenthesis to whisper.

_Not sure on that advice, I generally see em dashes used when writing quick asides?_

#### Examples

## Serial or Oxford Comma

No Oxford commas. :\(

#### Examples

Lindsay, Jessica and Amy — not Lindsay, Jessica, and Amy

## Percent vs %

Use the % symbol in all copy.

#### Examples

## Trademarks and Service Marks

Use appropriate trade/service mark symbol \(for example ®, ℠ or ™\) in headlines and in the first reference only in body copy, so long as the communication will correctly duplicate formatting with superscript.

_AP style is to not use TM symbol, only capitalization._
