# What is System Design?

As Roswell Park has grown our brand reach and increasing need for rapidly developed web properties has expanded. It's imperative that our messaging and branding consistently deliver the quality experience that Roswell Park is known for. Using a modern and standardized design language gives us the ability to achieve that consistency.

The ultimate aim of this project is to provide not only an overarching consistent look amongst our web properties but to also outline the use of the styles and components found within the language.
