# Mobile-First Considerations

## Page Layout

How we structure our pages to be mobile-friendly.

## Columns

Minimum number of columns used in mobile views. Either full-width or half-and-half.

## Buttons

Making sure that buttons and clickable elements are large enough and emphasized enough on mobile.

## Menus & Menu Locations

Standard locations of menus and clickable items in mobile views.
